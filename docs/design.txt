Jonathan Ellis rewrote pretty much everything, so a lot of the pattern noise is out of there now.

Neil Wrightman cleaned up the GUI, so now it is 1) prettier and 2) a lot more responsive!

11/26/01:
It's cleaned up a bit now.  PackageStmt is probably a good next target to clean.  The GUI sure is ugly, though.

Now the source code parsing stuff is in dire need of refactoring.

9/11/01:
Broke classes out into several packages, which reduces the clutter somewhat.  Added more unit tests.

The GUI is much better now, too.  But it could still use some work - maybe I could turn it into a wizard?  It does seem to have a pretty clear sequence of steps - set root, select files, process them, show results.
The parsing code is a little nicer now that it uses Visitor.  It's still pretty heinous, though.

It could use some work.  Especially the GUI.  And the parsing code is nasty too.  The one redeeming feature - it works.
